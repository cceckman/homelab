# Ansible-based homelab management

Nix is nice for some things, but I have a project stalled for quite a while based on the difficulty of bringing Python into Nix. Cross-arch builds are also quite inefficient.

So- going to give Ansible a go, as a way of having repeatable recipes that aren't shell.
